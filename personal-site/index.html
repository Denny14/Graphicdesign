		<p>As my entry point into Graphic Design, making and creating visual work has been my central skill for the past four years. However, recently I have learned my critical and problem-solving skills are also appropriate to my growing interest involvement in Graphic Design, as well as planning and creating. Making flexible, well-organized and easy to use designs is extremely satisfying for me.</p>
