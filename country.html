About Bulgaria
</h1>
<hr>
<h2>
Bulgaria, officially the Republic of Bulgaria, is a country in southeastern Europe.It is bordered by Romania to the north, 
Serbia and Macedonia to the west, Greece and Turkey to the south, and the Black Sea to the east. 
With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres (42,855 sq mi), Bulgaria is Europe's 16th-largest country. 
Organised prehistoric cultures began developing on current Bulgarian lands during the Neolithic period. 
Its ancient history saw the presence of the Thracians, Greeks, Persians, Celts, Romans, Goths, Alans and Huns. 
The emergence of a unified Bulgarian state dates back to the establishment of the First Bulgarian Empire in 681 AD, 
which dominated most of the Balkans and functioned as a cultural hub for Slavs during the Middle Ages. 
With the downfall of the Second Bulgarian Empire in 1396, its territories came under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries. 
The Russo-Turkish War of 1877â€“78 led to the formation of the Third Bulgarian State. The following years saw several conflicts with its neighbours,
which prompted Bulgaria to align with Germany in both world wars. In 1946 it became a one-party socialist state as part of the Soviet-led Eastern 
Bloc. In December 1989 the ruling Communist Party allowed multi-party elections, which subsequently led to Bulgaria's transition into a democracy 
and a market-based economy.Bulgaria's population of 7.2 million people is predominantly urbanised and mainly concentrated in the administrative 
centres of its 28 provinces. Most commercial and cultural activities are centred on the capital and largest city, Sofia. The strongest sectors of 
the economy are heavy industry, power engineering, and agriculture, all of which rely on local natural resources.The country's current political structure dates to the adoption of a democratic constitution in 1991. Bulgaria is a unitary parliamentary republic with a high degree of political, administrative, and economic centralisation. It is a member of the European Union, NATO, and the Council of Europe; a founding state of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE); and has taken a seat at the UN Security Council three times.

According to the Orthodox Christian tradition, on January 6 the priest throws a metal cross in the ice cold waters of the local river, while the bravest men try to fetch it first, bare chested and seemingly unaffected by the freezing temperatures. In one particular town, the ritual goes even further with men performing a traditional dance (horo) in the cold water. If you are in Bulgaria on that date, head for Kalofer and be there early in the morning to find a decent viewing point. If you dare to join the dance, remember that it is men only and that the first dance is for locals only.

In a few isolated villages in the rolling Strandzha Mountains near the Turkish border, a mystical ritual has survived till the present day. On the night of Saints         Constantine and Helen’s Day, villagers gather on the square to dance – barefoot – on burning embers. Reportedly, the dancers (called nestinari, нестинари) descend into a state of trance induced by a sacred drum, explaining the complete lack of pain felt by the participants.

More than 10,000 tons of steel were used for the construction of the NDK. That is 3,000 tons more than the Eiffel Tower. The main function of the building is a concert hall. It also hosts exhibitions and trade fairs. In front of the building is an underground arcade of shops and cafes.

The Statue of Sveta Sofia (English: The Statue of Saint Sophia; Bulgarian: Статуя на Света София; Transliteration: Statuya na Sveta Sofiya) is a monumental sculpture in Sofia, Bulgaria.
The statue, erected in 2000, stands in a spot once occupied by a statue of Lenin.
Sophia was considered too erotic and pagan to be referred to as a saint. 24 feet in height, the copper and bronze statue by the sculptor Georgi Chapkanov, stands on a 48 feet high pedestal. Adorned with the symbols of power (crown), fame (wreath) and wisdom (owl), the crown is also a reference to the Goddess of Fate – Tyche, inspired by the old emblem of Sofia dating back to 1900.
