<h3>My experiences Living Here</h3>
<p> I have been living in Lamoni for three straight years. I'm currently student at Graceland University. I enjoy living here for many reasons but one of the main reaons why I love living here, it is because there is nothing much to do. Since Lamoni it is a small town there are not many distractions and I can stay focus in school and this is very important to me. Also everyone knows each other and help each other if needed.
