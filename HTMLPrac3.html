<h3>My experiences Living Here</h3>
<p> I have been living in Lamoni, Iowa for three years and I'm currently student a at Graceland University. One positive thing about living in Lamoni is that High School and College students can stay focused in school and there are no distractions in this town. I have been staying in Lamoni for the past three summers as well as working and taking classes over the summer. Also, everyone knows each other and people help each other in this town. Lamoni is very relaxing and beautiful town. Instead of being on your phone all day you can go out and enjoy the beautiful nature with friends or family. You can even spend your time on so many other interesting activities here. However the one negative thing about living here is that if you are coming from a big city you are most likely going to be bored all the time and you will probably not be able to get use to this place. Also, there are not many grocery stores and the closest Walmart is 30 minutes away from Lamoni and this can be a struggle for students who do not have a car.
