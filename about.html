<h2>
	My name is Denislava Velkova and I’m originally from Bulgaria, Sofia which is located in Europe, next to Greece, Turkey, Serbia, and Romania. I came to the United States when I was 16 years old and I graduated High School in Jacksonville, Florida where part of my family lives for more than 25 years. After that I came to Graceland University. I’m currently attending Graceland University and I’m a Junior majoring in Graphic Design. I’m also, playing volleyball at Graceland University. I have earned many volleyball awards such as MVP, Captain of the season, Top setter of the season, All- Tournament player, and Heart of America NAIA. After I graduate I want to play professional volleyball in Europe for couple years and after that I want to continue working in the Graphic Design area and one day have my own company for Graphic Design. I love listening music, being at the gym to work out, and spending time with my family and friends when I have enough time.

	Experience
</h1>
<hr>
<h2>
As my entry point into Graphic Design, making and creating visual work has been my central skill for the past four years. Recently I have learned my critical and problem-solving skills are also appropriate to my growing interest involvement in Graphic Design, as well as planning and creating. Making flexible, well-organized and easy to use designs is extremely satisfying for me. 
	I have been working with Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop in my own time for over two years, and creating my own posters, logos, and websites using HTML. During this time I have designed and created several of my own logos, and posters. I also have taken a couple of IT courses and have a great understanding and interest in technology, and the latest trends and innovations. Most of my practice and experience are in mixed media such as graphic design, printmaking, 2- D Design, drawing, sculpture, and 3- D Design. My work is focused on more than one art style. Also, it is simple, clean, meaningful, and balanced.
